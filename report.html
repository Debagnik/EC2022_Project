    <h5 class=heading2>Introduction</h5>
    Microwaves are a kind of non-ionizing radiation with wavelengths starting from about one meter to at least one millimetre; with frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz. Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimetre wave) bands. A more common definition in radio-frequency engineering is that the range between 1 and 100 GHz (wavelengths between 0.3 m and three mm).[2] all told cases, microwaves include the whole SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum. Frequencies within the microwave range are often noted by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, Ku, K, or Ka-band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.
    The prefix micro- in microwave isn't meant to suggest a wavelength within the micrometre range. Rather, it indicates that microwaves are "small" (having shorter wavelengths), compared to the radio waves used before microwave technology. The boundaries between far infrared, terahertz radiation, microwaves, and ultra-high-frequency radio waves are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study.
    Microwaves surpass line-of-sight; unlike lower frequency radio waves they are doing not diffract around hills, follow the surface as ground waves, or reflect from the ionosphere, so terrestrial microwave communication links are limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km). At the high end of the band, they're absorbed by gases within the atmosphere, limiting practical communication distances to around a kilometre. Microwaves are widely utilized in modern technology, as an example in point-to-point communication links, wireless networks, microwave radio relay networks, radar, satellite and spacecraft communication, medical diathermy and cancer treatment, remote sensing, uranology, particle accelerators, spectroscopy, industrial heating, collision avoidance systems, garage door openers and keyless entry systems, and for cooking food in microwave ovens.
    <h5 class=heading2>HISTORY</h5>
    In the year 1864, James Clerk Maxwell first predicted the existence of microwaves by using his famous equations. Later in 1888, Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of microwaves by building a tool which produced microwaves and another device which detected it.
    Later in 1947 post-world-war, an American engineer named Percy Spencer while working in navy accidentally discovered the heating property of microwaves when the frozen peanut-butter snack-stick started melting. He discovered that microwave has the flexibility to create the polar molecule vibrate when it's emitted on them, this causes heat production. Thus, inventing the kitchen appliance.

    <h5 class=heading2>MEDICINAL APPLICATION</h5>
    Microwave technology is now widely utilized in a range of medical applications. most typically microwave energy is employed to make localized electrical phenomenon to desiccate human tissue - called microwave ablation. Common medical areas of application include:
    <ul type=disk>
      <li>Oncology</li>
      <li>Cardiology</li>
      <li>Gynecology</li>
      <li>Rhizotomy</li>
      <li>Otolaryngology (ENT)</li>
      <li>Ophthalmology</li>
      <li>Cosmetic treatments</li>
      <li>Dental treatments</li>
    </ul><p></p>
    Microwaves have played a very important role within the fight against cancer, providing a replacement way of treating the disease. Microwave ablation is usually utilized in the removal of unwanted tissue masses, as an example liver tumor, lung tumors and prostate ablation and also within the treatment of huge tumors. Cancer patients who are poor surgical candidates may like microwave ablation because it is minimally invasive.
    Frequency options
    A major advantage of microwave technology is flexibility - a large range of medical applications can like the range of frequencies available. as an example, systems operating at 915MHz and a pair of.45GHz are ideally suited to large volume ablation, while the utilization of upper frequencies is suitable for treatments like carcinoma, ablation of the center to treat arrhythmia, uterine fibroids, multiple small liver metastases, corneal ablation (vision correction), nerve ablation (back pain), vena treatment, verrucae treatment and plenty of other specific treatments. Higher frequency treatments within the range 5.8 GHz - 10 GHz can create shallow penetration of energy and are therefore ideal for surface-based treatments or anything that needs very precise ablations. Microwaves may be accustomed coagulate bleeding in highly vascular organs like the liver and spleen.
    Issues with Control<p>
    One common preconception is that microwaves are difficult to regulate. The widespread use of normal industrial magnetron power generators in medical equipment and also the trend of basing important measurements like reflected power on ideal 50-ohm microwave components have historically led to a variety of treatment issues.
    While modern microwave systems have advanced significantly and might provide stable and reliable solid-state sources, unreliability and uncertainty can arise when adopting this technology within the medical field. When using microwaves to treat any condition it's vital to require under consideration the changing dielectric properties of tissue. During treatment, these properties vary considerably therefore microwave applicators (antennas) aren't always optimally matched to a perfect 50 ohms - leading to significant mismatch.<p>
    This can create measurement uncertainty and VSWR problems. Any inaccuracy in these measurements has the potential to lead to either insufficient power being delivered - leading to poor treatments and a perception of unreliability, or excessive power being administered - inadvertently causing serious patient injury.
    <h5 class=heading2>MICROWAVES IN DIAGONISTICS</h5>
    Microwaves are widely utilized in resonance Imaging thanks to its non-invasive property. initially strong magnets are introduced within the patients’ body. This causes the protons to align their spin momentum to the sphere of magnetism. Then a pulsating microwave produced perpendicularly to the direction of the field. This end in deflection of the spin of the proton to either 90 to 180 degree betting on the character of the tissue. When the microwave stops emitting the proton re-aligns with the field which releases energy in kind of HF EM Waves. This produces an image for the doctors to dragonize
    <h5 class=heading2>CONCLUSION</h5>
    The discovery of microwaves is a boon to the medical community. Microwaves has proven time and again that its is the safest and most cost-effective EM Wave option for medicinal and diagnostic purposes. More advancements are made every year to make the instruments more precise and cost effective.
